# PCMatrix

Welcome to PCMatrix, a customizable PC components building website developed as part of our Systems Analysis and Design course project.

## Project Overview

In our Systems Analysis and Design course, we were tasked with developing a system from scratch. My team decided to create a customizable PC E-commerce website named **PCMatrix**. Our project includes a detailed report on the economic feasibility of the system, and we have also included a Gantt chart to show how we efficiently divided the work among the team members.

## Features

- Customizable PC build options.
- Secure checkout process.
