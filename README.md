A PC components building website that I developed as part of my Systems Analysis and Design course. 

During our Systems Analysis and Design course, we were all given the task of developing a system from scratch. My team chose to create a Customizable PC E-commerce Website. We put together a detailed report that covers the economic feasibility of the system, and we included a Gantt chart to show how we divided the work efficiently among the team.

A screenshot of the Home page of our website:

The Gantt Chart:

We also created a Network diagram which served as a roadmap of our project:

Thatâ€™s just a sneak peekâ€”less than 10% of what actually went into the report. But I'll spare you the boring details. ðŸ˜œ
